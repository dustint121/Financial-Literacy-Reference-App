    <h2>Life Insurance</h2>
    <p>In most cases, <b>life insurance</b> provides a promised amount of funds to the individuals(beneficaries) selected by the policy holder after the latter's death in exchange for a periodic premium. 
      In the case of an <b>endownment policy</b>, money is paid to the policy holder if he/she is alive after a specified date.
